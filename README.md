# viaCEP - Find your detailed address
This is an app that allows you to get a detailed address information given a valid CEP code,
(Valid only in Brazil) available at [https://notas.ferreiras.dev.br] The goal here is to learn how even a small app can take davantage of a desig pattern approach including services,
models
and controllers,
thanks to Prof Nelio Alves
and its approach on how to design
and develop software in a standardized approach.
